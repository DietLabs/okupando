=============

Single-page application with single-task focus -- checking if the toilet
is occupied or not.


Running
-------

You need to run it on Raspberry Pi.

After usual cloning and `npm install`ing, run
`npm start -- --gpio-channel CHANNEL_NO`, where `CHANNEL_NO` is
Raspberry Pi pin number where you have your microswitch plugged in.

By default server will run with no HTTPS and push notifications,
run `npm start -- --help` to see how to configure those.

### Physical installation

Our microswitch is shoved in a hole in the wall where toilet door‚Äôs lock
slides in. It‚Äôs padded with some folded paper and kept in place with hot
glue.

If you don‚Äôt have a good place to put your Raspberry Pi next to your
toilet door, it may make sense to solder ethernet cable to your
microswitch and use ethernet sockets to connect it to your Pi.
Obviously connection cannot go through the router, but ethernet switch
is fine. If that setup does not work, it may need that distance between
microswitch and Pi is too great, experiment with that.

### Microswitch setup

As of now, GPIO channel is set up in INPUT mode with PULL UP and change
interval of 200ms.


Developing
----------

Running server with no `--gpio-channel` and `NODE_ENV=development` will
start debug mode when you can change status with keypresses.
Run `npm run dev` to run server that restarts on every file change.
No browser reload at this point, though.

Run `npm start -- --help` for all available options.
